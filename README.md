### A new vocabulary for the front-end

![Menus](illustrations/menus.png "Menus")

**Look at the menus.** What do you see? I don't see `div` and `li` and
`dl`, I see *groups* and *items* and *descriptions* and *selections.* So
let's just use markup that says what we mean.

### Abstracted from Real Sites

The markup in this project comes from experiments replicating parts of
real sites. The challenge is to collect a wide assortment of screenshots
of actual page items, like menus, then invent one piece of clean markup
that can be styled to look like any of them.

### Translated by JSON-Template

<img src="illustrations/render-fb.png" alt="Facebook Style" align="left" />
```json
[
  { "url": "#", "id": "news",     "text": "News Feed",    "selected": true },
  { "url": "#", "id": "messages", "text": "Messages",     "description": "9" },
  { "url": "#", "id": "friends",  "text": "Find Friends", "description": "6" },
  { "url": "#", "id": "events",   "text": "Events" },
  { "url": "#", "id": "photos",   "text": "Photos" }
]
```

<img src="illustrations/render-twitter.png" alt="Twitter Style" align="left" />
```json
[
  {
     "text": "",
     "id": "gear",
     "description": "Settings and help",
     "groups": [
      {
        "items": [
          { "id": "profile", "url": "#", "text": "John Doe", "description": "Edit profile" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "items": [
          { "url": "#", "text": "Direct Messages", "selected": true },
          { "url": "#", "text": "Lists" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "items": [
          { "url": "#", "text": "Help" },
          { "url": "#", "text": "Keyboard Shortcuts" },
          { "url": "#", "text": "Twitter Ads" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "items": [
          { "url": "#", "text": "Settings" },
          { "url": "#", "text": "Sign out" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### One Markup, Many Styles

By challenging the markup to look like many diverse and popular sites,
we arrive at the most flexible markup. The high-level domain specific
language translates into semantic HTML that is eminently styleable with
CSS.

### Interactive Demo

The showpiece
[playground](http://begriffs.github.io/showpiece/playground) uses an
old-fashioend JSON template language to generate the markup. It is a
good place to experiment with creating a new widget style. We're porting
this approach to AngularJS. It dynamically loads templates, examples,
and styles from this repo and provides quick feedback.

### Contributing

So far this project includes a template for menus, but it still needs
templates for every other kind of common web widget To name a few:
breadcrumbs, forms, and pagination links.

You can also improve existing templates. Here's how. Take a screenshot
of a widget on a real site. Let's say it's a menu on www.foo.com. And
the screenshot to `wild/menus/foo.png`. Now try to define the showpiece
structure of the menu and save it in `templates/menu/examples/foo.json`.
Finally try to style the markup that showpiece generates and save your
style to `templates/menu/styles/foo.css`. If the markup isn't flexible
enough to let you style the widget correctly then submit an issue to
this repo.
